# slices

If you are on Go v1.18+ and v1.21-, and want support for the new slices functionality coming to the stdlib in v1.21,
then this package is for you.

It's basically `golang.org/x/exp/slices` extracted into a stand-alone package.
Once your project has been upgraded to Go 1.21, it should be easy to remove this package and switch to the corresponding
functions in Go's stdlib.

Make sure to check the online documentation for [golang.org/x/exp/slices](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slices) for usage information.
